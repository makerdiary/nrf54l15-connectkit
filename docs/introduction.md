# nRF54L15 Connect Kit<br/><small>Rapid Prototyping Kit for Your Next-Gen IoT Devices powered by the nRF54L15 Multiprotocol SoC</small>

## Introduction

nRF54L15 Connect Kit is a rapid prototyping kit built around the [nRF54L15] multiprotocol
SoC featuring a 128 MHz Arm Cortex速-M33 processor and a 128 MHz RISC-V coprocessor with
1.5 MB NVM and 256 KB RAM. It supports Bluetooth Low Energy 6.0, Thread速, Matter, Zigbee速,
4 Mbps proprietary 2.4 GHz mode, NFC and enhanced security.

The design integrates an [nRF52820]-based Interface MCU that enables onboard debugging and
programming, eliminating the need for external tools. The Interface MCU also includes a
USB-UART bridge for log, trace and terminal emulation, and an Interface Shell bundled with
helpful commands to access the board-specific functionality.

The board contains a [TPS63901] buck-boost converter with 75-nA quiescent current and 1.8V/3.3V
configurable power supply for I/Os, supporting various options for easily powering the unit
from USB-C, external supplies or batteries.

It also has USB-C, LEDs, Buttons, U.FL receptacles for U.FL cabled 2.4 GHz Antenna and 13.56
MHz NFC Antenna, Arm Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port and dual-row 40 pins with loose or pre-soldered
headers available.

[nRF Connect SDK] is supported, including the [Zephyr RTOS]. Developers can explore the full
potential of the nRF54L15 using the extensive range of software samples, modules, and libraries
available within the nRF Connect SDK. It is open source, and can be leveraged and modified to
suit your specific needs.
