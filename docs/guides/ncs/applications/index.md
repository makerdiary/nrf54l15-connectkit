# Applications

A set of example applications are provided to show how to implement typical user scenarios using the nRF54L15 Connect Kit. Applications typically include a fully integrated software stack and can serve as a starting point for developing your product. They use interface drivers and libraries from the nRF Connect SDK and its set of repositories to implement a specific use case, while [Samples] showcase a single feature or library.
